# To Do List

This project was made by Leptonite. It was made to be a showcase project to show off the dev skill. If you wonder, it was made with various technologies. I wrote this app using Typescript; the write-more-for-less-bugs programming language.

As of Front-End, I use React. It is a fast and easy to use. But I also like Svelte. Probably I gonna use it on my next showcase project.

This app is a relatively small app. I don't even need to use a state management, but again, since this was meant to be a showcase app, I use a fancy state management called Redux. More specifically Redux Toolkit as it is the best practive to implement Redux. And don't forget React Redux to bind Redux to React.

You may see some animations when opening modal and select. I didn't use CSS animation there. Instead I use Framer Motion to handle it. It is JavaScript-based animation library. I know it might be too complex for this small project. But trust me, making CSS animation manually is much more complex.

And finally to maintain data locally, I use indexedDB. I use jake archibald' indexedDB to help me interacting with idb. Really recommend it since it uses Promise instead of Event.

That's all. You can copy this project and edit it as you want. Leave me a massage in azmiarzaki@gmail.com in case you have any question.
